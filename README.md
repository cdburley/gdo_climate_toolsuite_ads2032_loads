# gdo_climate_toolsuite_ads2032_loads
This repository houses the raw data and processing scripts to create the hourly load time series by 
Balancing Authority for the GDO Climate Toolsuite project. Data are scaled to match the 2032 annual total loads data by 
BA from the WECC 2032 Anchor Data Set (ADS). 2032 ADS loads were shared by Osten on 11-Aug 2025. The future loads for 
different weather years are based on the Total ELectricity Loads (TELL) model.

## Input Files
The input data needed to recreate this process is stored in the [data](data/) directory. Because of data volume 
constraints I didn't push the raw TELL multilayer perceptron (MLP) model output to this directory so the workflow 
cannot be immediately reproduced. This data is readily available though if we want to package this workflow in a 
fully reproducible manner.

## Output Files
The output of this processing is stored in the [TELL_Loads](data/TELL_Loads) subdirectory with the filenames 
"TELL_Loads_2032_Based_on_YYYY_Weather.csv".

## Notes
1) Loads in CISO, IPCO, NEVP, and PACE are modeled as a whole in TELL but are separated in GridView. To create the data
for these BAs I used the whole load simulated by TELL and distributed it to the subregions within the BA using the 
annual total load in each subregion to portion out the TELL loads. This means those BAs will have the same
hour-to-hour variability (governed by the BA map in TELL) but different magnitudes.
2) The BAs in Canada (AESO and BCHA) and Mexico (CFE) are not modeled by TELL. The time-series for those BAs are the 
same as those in the original GridView file. Likewise, there are no values for TH_Malin, TH_Mead, and TH_PV.
3) The WECC 2032 ADS is formatted for a leap year (i.e., it has 8784 hourly load values). Because the historical 
weather data input into TELL only have 8760 hourly values in non-leap years this means that the final day of loads is 
"missing" in the output files in non leap years.
